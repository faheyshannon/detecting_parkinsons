#Detecting Parkinsons in a Patient- Python

#Used Machine Learning techniques to analyze the Oxford University Parkinson's Disease detection data and build models for classification and prediction
#Used Exploratory Data Analysis techniques using heatmaps and feature importance to determine which features should be used for certain models
#Built XGBoost, Random Forest Classifiers, and Logistic Regression models to determine which model produced the most accurate result in detecting Parkinson's Disease through voice analytics
#Evaluated results and created recommendations on how the model could be improved and how this project could be implemented moving forward
